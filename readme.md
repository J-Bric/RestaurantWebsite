# Restaurant Website Project
This website is perfect for publishing menus, as it has a simple and functional CMS, for publishing new dishes, and categories.
All the images, posts, database, and server are hosted on Amazon Web Services.

## The site was built with the following technologies:
+ PHP 7
+ Laravel 5.7
+ JavaScript ES6
+ AJAX
+ APIs
+ MySQL
+ AWS S3

## Pages

### Home
The home page only shows the landing page, the logo, navbar, and the popular dishes which can be simply changed by the admin on its CMS.

### Menu 
The menu is ordered by categories created by the admin.

### Locations
On this page you can select the closest restaurant to you. The admin can simply add more locations just by adding the address of the restaurant and then the client will be able to search it on the Locations page.
